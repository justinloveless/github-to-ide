### Migration Guide

If you've already installed the native host using the old curl method, you don't need to do anything! It will continue to work.

If you want to reinstall using the npm package:

1. Get your extension ID from `chrome://extensions`
2. Run: `npx gh2ide --extension-id <your-id>`
3. Restart your browser

That's it! The npm installer will overwrite the old installation.

### Troubleshooting

**"npm not found" or "npx not found"**
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (includes npm and npx)
- Requires Node.js 16 or higher

**"No response from native host"**
1. Restart your browser after installation
2. Verify extension ID matches: `npx gh2ide --extension-id <your-id>`
3. Test connection from extension options page
