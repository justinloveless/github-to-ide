## Privacy Practices Tab

### Single Purpose Description
```
This extension intercepts GitHub repository and file links and opens them directly in the user's preferred IDE (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains Rider, or custom editors) through a local native messaging helper, eliminating manual copy-paste workflows.
```

### Permission Justifications

#### Host Permissions (https://github.com/*)
```
Required to inject UI elements into GitHub pages (header dropdown for editor selection) and to intercept GitHub repository and file links when clicked by the user. The extension only functions on GitHub.com and does not access any other websites.
```

#### nativeMessaging
```
Essential for communicating with the local native host application that launches the user's chosen IDE with the appropriate repository path and file location. This is the core mechanism that enables opening GitHub links in local editors.
```

#### notifications
```
Used to provide user feedback when repositories are being cloned, files are being opened, or when errors occur (e.g., repository not found locally, IDE not available). Notifications keep users informed of the extension's actions and status. Also used to display a one-time welcome message with setup instructions.
```

#### scripting
```
Required to inject content scripts into GitHub pages to add the editor selection dropdown in the page header and to intercept link clicks. This enables the extension's UI integration with GitHub's interface.
```

#### storage
```
Used to persist user configuration including: preferred default editor, clone directory paths, per-repository editor preferences, auto-open toggle state, and custom editor definitions. No user data is transmitted externally; all storage is local.
```

#### tabs
```
Required to detect which GitHub page the user is viewing (to show repository-specific settings) and to optionally close tabs after successfully opening content in the IDE. This enhances the user experience by maintaining context.
```

#### webNavigation
```
Used to detect when users navigate to different GitHub pages (repositories, files, pull requests) to update the header UI with the appropriate editor options and repository context. This ensures the extension UI stays synchronized with page navigation.
```

#### Remote Code
```
This extension does NOT use remote code. All code is packaged within the extension. The native messaging host is a separate local application that users install manually on their machine - it is not remote code executed by the extension.
```

### Data Usage Certification

- **Does this item collect or transmit user data?** ‚Üí **No**
- **Does this item use personal or sensitive user data?** ‚Üí **No**

**Explanation:**
```
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data externally. All configuration settings (editor preferences, clone paths) are stored locally using Chrome's storage API and never leave the user's device. The extension only communicates with a local native messaging host on the user's machine to launch IDE applications.
