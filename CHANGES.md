# Changes Made to Address Chrome Web Store Review

## Summary
This document outlines the improvements made to address the Chrome Web Store reviewer recommendations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed autoOpenEnabled Initialization Inconsistency
**File:** `extension/content.js`
- **Issue:** Race condition where `content.js` initialized `autoOpenEnabled = true` while `background.js` set it to `false` on install
- **Fix:** Changed default value in `content.js` from `true` to `false` to match `background.js`
- **Impact:** Consistent behavior across extension components, prevents unexpected auto-opening before user opts in

### 2. ✅ Added First-Run Notification
**File:** `extension/background.js`
- **Feature:** New welcome notification shown on first install
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `showFirstRunNotification()` function
  - Displays notification with "Open Options" and "Dismiss" buttons
  - Modified `chrome.notifications.onButtonClicked` listener to handle both setup notifications and existing prompt notifications
- **Impact:** Users are immediately informed about setup requirements and guided to the options page

### 3. ✅ Added Early URL Filtering in Content Script
**File:** `extension/content.js`
- **Issue:** Every GitHub link click triggered a message to background script, even for non-repository URLs
- **Fix:** Added `isRelevantGitHubUrl()` function that filters URLs before sending messages
  - Validates URL has at least owner/repo components
  - Excludes GitHub system pages (settings, notifications, explore, etc.)
  - Only allows repository-related URL types (blob, tree, commits, pull, issues, etc.)
- **Impact:** Significantly reduces unnecessary message passing, improves performance

### 4. ✅ Added Test Connection Button
**Files:** `extension/options.html`, `extension/options.js`, `native-host/index.js`
- **Feature:** New "Test native host connection" button in options page
- **Implementation:**
  - Added UI button and status indicator in options.html
  - Added `setConnectionStatus()` helper function with color-coded feedback
  - Added event handler to send ping request to native host
  - Added `ping` action handler in native host that responds with `PONG`
- **Impact:** Users can verify native host installation without leaving the options page

### 5. ✅ Added Visual Indicator for Native Host Status
**File:** `extension/background.js`
- **Feature:** Extension badge shows warning when native host is not connected
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `nativeHostConnected` state variable
  - Added `checkNativeHostConnection()` function called on startup
  - Added `updateNativeHostStatus()` function that updates badge and title
  - Integrated status checks into `sendNativeMessage()` calls
- **Badge Behavior:**
  - Shows red "!" badge when native host is disconnected
  - Updates tooltip to explain the issue
  - Clears badge when connection is established
- **Impact:** Users have immediate visual feedback about extension status

## Files Modified

### Extension Files
- `extension/background.js` - First-run notification, native host status tracking
- `extension/content.js` - Fixed initialization, added URL filtering
- `extension/options.html` - Added test connection button and status indicator
- `extension/options.js` - Added test connection functionality and UI helpers

### Native Host Files
- `native-host/index.js` - Added ping/pong handler for connection testing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **First Install Flow:**
   - Install extension (load unpacked)
   - Verify welcome notification appears
   - Click "Open Options" button to confirm navigation works

2. **Native Host Status:**
   - Before installing native host: verify red "!" badge appears on extension icon
   - After installing native host: verify badge clears
   - Test connection button should show error before install, success after

3. **URL Filtering:**
   - Visit GitHub homepage, click various links (settings, explore, etc.)
   - Verify these don't trigger auto-open (check console logs)
   - Visit a repository, click file/directory links
   - Verify these DO trigger the extension (if auto-open enabled)

4. **Consistency:**
   - Verify auto-open defaults to OFF on fresh install
   - Toggle auto-open in popup, verify content script respects setting

## Chrome Web Store Privacy Tab Responses

All required justifications have been prepared (see previous conversation). Key points:

- **Single Purpose:** Intercept GitHub links and open them in local IDEs
- **No Data Collection:** All data stored locally, no external transmission
- **Native Messaging:** Essential for communicating with local IDE applications
- **Permissions:** All permissions justified and necessary for core functionality

## Additional Notes

- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All changes are additive improvements to user experience
- Code quality maintained with consistent style and error handling
- No linter errors introduced
